# Live Threat Map

A real-time 3D visualization of simulated global cyber attacks. This project uses a 3D globe to visualize threat data with a cyber-punk aesthetic.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Globe**: Built with Three.js and Globe.gl.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Visualizes attacks as animated arcs between countries.
- **Live Statistics**: Tracks attacks per second, top targets, and total events.
- **Cyber Aesthetic**: Dark mode design with neon accents, CRT scanlines, and atmospheric glow.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Custom animations, CRT effects)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Globe.gl](https://globe.gl/)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/urumb/DDOS-attack-map.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

> **Note**: An active internet connection is required to load the 3D libraries and textures from CDNs.
